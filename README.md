Google Chrome Extension for Downloading YouTube Videos

### Intention  
The intention of this google chrome extension is to give accessibility to easily being able to download YouTube videos straight from the page of the video. A dropdown is added in the secondary actions row (next to share and report actions) where one can click on links to download the video they're watching in various formats that YouTube provides (but hides from your eyes; that's what this extension reveals).  

What is convenient about this is that you no longer have to go to another website to get this action done. You can get it done where it should be anyway!  

Feel free to modify this extension to your heart's content and let me know of any issues! I made this extension to solve the problem that I was running into. I was unsatisfied with the solutions that others had attempted. Hope this helps you!

To use this extension: download the source, go to the chrome extensions settings page (chrome://extensions/), enable developer mode (it's in the extensions page on top right), and click unload packed extension. Navigate to where you downloaded the source and load it up! Good luck!
